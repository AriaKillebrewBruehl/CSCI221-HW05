# Homework 05: some digital circuits

This homework is due by the end of the day on Monday, March 2nd. You are to complete the work of
[Lab 05](https://jimfix.github.io/csci221/assigns/lb05.html) and submit five `.circ` files (six if
you complete the bonus Problem 3b). Put all these circuits in a branch of this repo on GitHub, and
then issue a pull request so that we can take a look at them.

Please build your circuits so that they are in "sum of products" (SOP) form. If you would like to submit
alternate designs (say, ones not in SOP form), just put `-alt` in the filename. For example, if you built
an alternative 4:1 MUX for Problem 2b that is not in SOP form, you would hand it in as `4to1mux-alt.circ`.

If you feel the need to explain your circuit designs, you can put text labels within your circuit. A
possibly better alternative is to include a `DOC.md` file that documents your circuits' designs. You'll
especially want to include this if your designs were tricky, or if you came up with an alternative
(e.g. non-SOP) design than what was suggested by the problem description.
